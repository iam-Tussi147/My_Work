Description: This package provides tools for aligning and analyzing immune receptor sequences such as T-cell receptors and immunoglobulins. It allows users to perform pairwise alignments of test sequences against reference V and J regions, assess match scores, and evaluate junction productivity to determine if a sequence is in-frame and functional. Designed to support research and analysis in immunogenetics, the package enables the exploration of immune repertoire diversity and function.
